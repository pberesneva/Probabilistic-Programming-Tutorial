# Tutorial on Probabilistic Programming

## Exercise
File `01 coin toss example.ipynb` shows a simple stochastic process: flipping a coin.
Our certainty about the true mean of this experiment increases with the number of observations.

What is the probability, that the coin is fair?

Please formulate a Bayesian model for this research question
* in full sentences (e.g. my prior beliefs are, ...)
* as mathematical formulas 
* using PyMC3 
and hit the inference button of PyMC3 for simulated test data.
The data can be generated using the provided example or with your own routines.

How does your certainty (posterior) increase with additional data?
